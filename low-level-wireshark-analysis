Incident Title

Suspicious DNS Beaconing Activity Detected

Date

1015-12-30

Summary

Suspicious DNS and HTTP traffic was detected originating from a single internal host. The traffic pattern indicates possible command-and-control (C2) beaconing behavior.

Observations

Repetitive DNS queries to non-standard domains

High entropy domain names

Regular time intervals between requests

HTTP GET requests without user-agent diversity

Analysis

DNS traffic analysis revealed periodic queries occurring every few seconds, suggesting automated behavior rather than human activity. The queried domains do not appear in known legitimate services.

HTTP traffic following DNS resolution indicates potential C2 callback behavior.

Impact

If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow:

Remote command execution

Data exfiltration

Persistent access to the internal network

Conclusion

The observed traffic is consistent with beaconing behavior commonly associated with malware C2 communication.
